These icons will maintain their original upstream licenses being:

 * GPL v2 for Humanity Icons
 * GPL v3.0 for Ubuntu Mate Icons

I shall not receive any credit for this because work isn't mine, I just grabbed the
Ubuntu MATE themes & rebranded them to fit Debian 9 Stretch for personal use.

If you want to cooperate however you are free to.
