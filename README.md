# Prelude

I shall not receive any credit for this because work isn't mine, I just
grabbed the Ubuntu MATE themes & rebranded them to fit Debian 9 Stretch
for personal use.

Since Debian 9 does not have the Ubuntu Humanity Icons, I decided to
package these icons with most of it's dependencies included & I'll 
also try to include wallpapers & other UM stuff rebranded for Debian
(As long as the license permits it)

If you want to cooperate you are free to.

# Dependencies
Ambiant Mate, Radiant Mate & Ambiant Mate Dark depend on `gtk 3.22`.


# To Do List

- [] Finish adding base icons
- [] Recolor orange ubuntu icons
- [] Add Debian wallpapers
- [] Add more mimetypes

# Copyright
These icons will maintain their original upstream licenses being:

 * GPL v2 for Humanity Icons
 * GPL v3 for Ubuntu Mate Icons

**NEW!** Added Humanity Colors from @Ravefinity

A big thanks to the people who is making this possible:
